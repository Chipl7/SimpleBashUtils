Sun of the sleepless! Melancholy star!
Whose tearful beam glows    tremulously far,
That show’st the darkness thou canst not dispel
How like art thou to joy remember’d well!




So gleams the past, the light of other days
Which shines, but warms not     with its powerless rays;
A night-beam    sorrow watcheth    to behold,


Distinct, but   distant —		 clear, but   oh, how cold
