



My life is a fault at last, I fear:
It seems too    much like a fate, indeed!
Though I do my best I shall scarce succeed.
But what if I fail of my purpose here?


            
It is but to keep the nerves at strain,
To dry one's eyes   and laugh at a fall,
And baffled, get up to begin again,-
So the chase takes up one's life, that's all.
